We are tasked to learn how to use the arguments passed to your program. 
we need to know what the two prototypes of main are, and in which cases we use each one of them.
We need to know how to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters.
We also have to create a readme file as well as a main.h file at the root of this directory. We are allowed to use the standard library this time. 
We need to use the Betty style coding /** words**/
This is all done using C language.
